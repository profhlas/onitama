# Onitama clone  
by Shimpei Sato

A two-player abstract game where a player wins by capturing the opponent’s main token (called a “master”) or by moving a token to the opponent’s middle space (called a “Temple”). Players can move their five tokens only using two patterns, with the used pattern becoming available to the opponent.
